It is much more that case that the “good people” themselves, that is, the noble, powerful, higher-ranking and higher-thinking people felt and set themselves and their actions up as good, that is to say, of the first rank, in contrast to everything low, low-minded, common, and vulgar. From this pathos of distance they first arrogated to themselves the right to create values, to stamp out the names for values. What did they care about usefulness!</p>\n<h1 id=\"although-the-two-words-bad-and-evil-both-seem-opposite-to-the-same-idea-of-good-how-different-they-are\"><a href=\"#although-the-two-words-bad-and-evil-both-seem-opposite-to-the-same-idea-of-good-how-different-they-are\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>“Although the two words “bad” and “evil” both seem opposite to the same idea of “good,” how different they are.”</h1>\n<p>In relation to such a hot pouring out of the highest rank-ordering, rank-setting judgments of value, the point of view which considers utility is as foreign and inappropriate as possible. Here the feeling has reached the opposite of that low level of warmth which is a condition for that calculating shrewdness, that calculation by utility—and not just for a moment, not for an exceptional hour, but permanently. The pathos of nobility and distance, as mentioned, the lasting and domineering feeling, something total and complete, of a higher ruling nature in relation to a lower nature, to an “beneath”—that is the origin of the opposition between “god” and “bad.” (The right of the master to give names extends so far that we could permit ourselves to grasp the origin of language itself as an expression of the power of the rulers: they say “that is such and such,” seal every object and event with a sound and, in so doing, take possession of it.)</p>\n<p>Given this origin, the word “good” was not in any way necessarily tied up with “unegoistic” actions, as the superstitions of those genealogists of morality tell us. Rather, that occurs for the first time with the collapse of aristocratic value judgments, when this entire contrast between “egoistic” and “unegoistic” pressed itself ever more strongly into human awareness—it is, to use my own words, the instinct of the herd which, through this contrast, finally gets its word (and its words). And even so, it took a long time until this instinct in the masses became ruler, with the result that moral evaluation got downright hung up and bogged down on this opposition (as is the case, for example, in modern Europe: today the prejudice that takes “moralistic,” “unegoistic,” “<em>désintéressé</em>” <em>[disinterested]</em> as equally valuable ideas already governs, with the force of a “fixed idea” and a disease of the brain).</p>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"d3424bc576b0431637c43c58ea8002f4","title":"Ne te quaesiveris extra","path":"/blog/ne-te-quaesiveris-extra/","author":"Ralph Waldo Emerson","date":"August 09 2019","hero_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/pawel-czerwinski-8uZPynIu-rQ-unsplash-1.08ac62e.f81fb102e30ae37faff213afa5c13b8e.jpg","size":{"width":1000,"height":1500},"sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px","srcset":["/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/pawel-czerwinski-8uZPynIu-rQ-unsplash-1.fffb11a.f81fb102e30ae37faff213afa5c13b8e.jpg 480w","/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/pawel-czerwinski-8uZPynIu-rQ-unsplash-1.08ac62e.f81fb102e30ae37faff213afa5c13b8e.jpg 1000w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1000 1500' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-6ccdef6a63fbfa7f21c23806f44d5b79'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-6ccdef6a63fbfa7f21c23806f44d5b79)' width='1000' height='1500' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bR866DHiwd/4rgwqkDJqJKRgNKyqPU1YMepFaLLDzxCYFBPEelEKvMcEDYUJHcCQBYxxAd8Y/WjYY3ZRnwjzP8VW/Hce6dwg2of1LGny88o3O0ae/U0AQVDYO53ZqllliCAbrux9T1qoDhwM5Y11VxE1YLsMSKpjPXxdaifE3CvTvVsrYHLTdj8RpdeX8dv4IyC3c9amqljxC3amgb35/uhCpWC7Bgg/ERn5CqEa0VuJo5Jn/ABMQTSWa85p8LMzE1KO4KtwsSX/Ai5I%2bVFCggcxTZrmtfIE0S6iVIEVuAO2TV630pGWAX2O9IYmvtuTp9w5x1cYqMv2tnx2ksa/6mqvApPr7kzqbsckx/gjO5Oar4hGHkdgAO56Cu5GOcZA71kNd1pbl/q1u5WFdgw6ufP2r1NLWnAlltnhOPiMbrUmuGaG3PCvc9zQcsaxoXlbAAySx/ehLKSG3t5JpHCRIMs5PSs5rusXF4QI%2bVFAAGHMOfmu2T%2bgz3pjTpyzbU6iu6wsctyY8N/xEixi4s7c1zwg%2b3fHt86rlkv1VeG6SFQN0iHCD6msjAbu7ugkVxLM7NsUYgAe3TFaBLZ5eXYQZnn6tuSB%2bdGNQtfeJFCw69/EZaVrpjuBDJcs7KctwZc48vKvQtC1L6zGGWKdV83GM0j0D6OQ2cKq6cT9WwNifU1pYoimAdh2A2pDr7aXOEE0mg09gXdZ9e5j9evHmMlrbHC9JpAen%2bI/msm0IMnLBQJku7kYKY7k9xjfFa3UoooIFCqEjUbAV55rmpNKzQwDwndvI48/T96caJNw2pM9dcd249zvVtUSRFhhYx2sfwZ%2bJz%2bL3/wDDzpBbWc9/dC3gy3MO5JJP5mmmk6Pda%2bJ356W9tAQrSOM5PtWg0Sx%2bzbXlgh7qRiCw7LTE2JQpVO4OoLd%2b/cv0/TY7ODkQOI16Sz43J8lFaf6PrEimLTYODJ8UjjLt60ktdNudXvfq8MhihTeaUDAUZ6D3reWMFvYWois0wq7F23JpFrrwBtJyT/cxxoNK9hynA%2bf1DLWJ4wDNIx9M7/1RkJjklBYqPKk7XDnfNGaern7yYY22Gd/ekbgnkzSDTeJO55p9L9RaSVooBnsAPKsfOhjhwxLTOcYA/Stz9lSBXmuvFM/ib09KTRaa93qSxoAMnPEeiqOprXaaxK0wPUxDAkk%2b5z6LWWoNa3NtasDZs4LKRgs%2b2TxdhWgezaLlwrwvcuOEYOQo7k00iWOw09VgXhjHhQd2Pmau03T5CTNJvI3xOeg9BQF2q3Ev0IRTp9xCDmF6Xax2lsLeHcdWbuzdyaL5n3PKVe%2bSfKpWyRMCkbK3CcE5q9Ywp2G9JrH3MSZqqdlKDI6g6RN1QAnzamNtJDDHmQI8nYAd6oSJubkgMO2ahMHhxg5XyP8AdVkbuMybX7%2bxxFU1vxRHOOlLNLs1NzMwHhY4/IdvzNONSlVQY4zv3NB2CvI3DFlUHVqZK5CGZk1B7QiDM7uAWnyiczlfCp6Z8z%2bwoOW4uZJOFpNum3Qegp1ccNtb%2bFfYeZqGn2IiYTTgNMdwp6J/3UPKqruI/wAh76BwwrQ89n4E5p1vLFHxPx5PY0XHfrC%2bHQjHkck1Ocng2%2bdLXspLpgofgz0CjxYqgbbOXlmpVtMFWvmNra95gVmjIz1wc4qbyrNGQenqOlDJpZt7cKq8w/5GuGAxyhQxUlAyo3Y%2bVUFUJyphFFp/EMJ//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"content":"<p>I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional.

We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents.</p>\n<h1 id=\"there-is-a-time-in-every-mans-education-when-he-arrives-at-the-conviction-that-envy-is-ignorance-that-imitation-is-suicide-that-he-must-take-himself-for-better-for-worse\"><a href=\"#there-is-a-time-in-every-mans-education-when-he-arrives-at-the-conviction-that-envy-is-ignorance-that-imitation-is-suicide-that-he-must-take-himself-for-better-for-worse\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>“There is a time in every man’s education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse…”</h1>\n<p>It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.</p>\n<p>Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"777a70e288497422b145a47e6649646a","title":"Sunflower

Think of a man’s swinging dumb-bells for his health, when those springs are bubbling up in far-off pastures unsought by him!</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1501 2254' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-f50bce87cb01673e3d873b6553578614'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-f50bce87cb01673e3d873b6553578614)' width='1501' height='2254' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABgAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwABAQEBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECCAMFBgf/xAA0EAABAwEFBgMGBwEAAAAAAAABAAIRIQMEEjFBBQgiMlFhBhORB3GhscHhJDNCUmJkkvH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQES/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDqIKqBVAREQEREBERBlVREGkUlVAREQEREEhRaUKCKhREGkWVZQVFFUH5btT23%2bDrgS2zvlvfHf1bBzh6mAvr143iNiMtA2x2PtK0YTAc51mwfMrl4vIhwkgZjULQdDs5Y4K8pXSj94u6S7y/Dt5MZYr00T6NXlZ7xtiSQ/wAO2ggVAvYmf8Lm8VBxCRoqXljKEkDrUhWYV0tY7xuzp/EbBvTWxzMvDXQe8gL2bvE7KloOwb9J/beLM/RcyBzS0OAEHMtzTywQDZmW5xl6JMHUdhvDbALJvOydqWTpghps3wOuYXzty9t/gu8jjv8Ab3YkgDz7s8T3kTRcfFzw4GvvVxVig%2bX2U5K8mksM8zHZFHQwwa2Z%2bCjfyy0UI0Rplpbm0BaRoEjgnThPVVjpFKRmOi8%2bQQZdZmvcKukkEHi0doUGqNdQ4ZyIylVjiGvaRxCtNVgwJdHCaOb0Vggc2XK7p9kHtZv4Q0mSMp1CNDXg9ZyXjXDJBjtp3C1iIOIRijTJwRWKUa4w8ZFMLpxCA8Z9HLFocTQ7OFu0OJgcCiDiedop%2bppQjC3EwSw6FaY/FZAjMUUs3cDhAkHLqEEFACCS3Q6jsqCIAmAciNE4WihPlu%2bCosyCQ6CDrofuggJacLhQ9PorIAhxpNHdPeshpMtPL/LRBMGfXP8A6EH/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e\" width=\"1501\" data-srcset=\"/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/kunj-parekh-H69EgivmCjE-unsplash.82a2fbd.846707613dc1d91aed7bb9f472da3c0a.jpg 480w, /brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/kunj-parekh-H69EgivmCjE-unsplash.cbab2cf.846707613dc1d91aed7bb9f472da3c0a.jpg 1024w, /brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/kunj-parekh-H69EgivmCjE-unsplash.5bead50.846707613dc1d91aed7bb9f472da3c0a.jpg 1501w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1501px) 100vw, 1501px\" data-src=\"/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/kunj-parekh-H69EgivmCjE-unsplash.5bead50.846707613dc1d91aed7bb9f472da3c0a.jpg\"><noscript><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded\" src=\"/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/kunj-parekh-H69EgivmCjE-unsplash.5bead50.846707613dc1d91aed7bb9f472da3c0a.jpg\" width=\"1501\"></noscript></p>\n<p>Moreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only beast which ruminates when walking. When a traveller asked Wordsworth’s servant to show him her master’s study, she answered, “Here is his library, but his study is out of doors.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we should be more susceptible to some influences important to our intellectual and moral growth, if the sun had shone and the wind blown on us a little less; and no doubt it is a nice matter to proportion rightly the thick and thin skin. But methinks that is a scurf that will fall off fast enough,–that the natural remedy is to be found in the proportion which the night bears to the day, the winter to the summer, thought to experience. There will be so much the more air and sunshine in our thoughts. The callous palms of the laborer are conversant with finer tissues of self-respect and heroism, whose touch thrills the heart, than the languid fingers of idleness. That is mere sentimentality that lies abed by day and thinks itself white, far from the tan and callus of experience.</p>\n<p>When we walk, we naturally go to the fields and woods: what would become of us, if we walked only in a garden or a mall? Even some sects of philosophers have felt the necessity of importing the woods to themselves, since they did not go to the woods. “They planted groves and walks of Platanes,” where they took <em>subdiales ambulationes</em> in porticos open to the air. Of course it is of no use to direct our steps to the woods, if they do not carry us thither. I am alarmed when it happens that I have walked a mile into the woods bodily, without getting there in spirit. In my afternoon walk I would fain forget all my morning occupations and my obligations to society. But it sometimes happens that I cannot easily shake off the village. The thought of some work will run in my head, and I am not where my body is,–I am out of my senses. In my walks I would fain return to my senses.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"d4a3c2bcd3ff7077a45dc69f20699c02","title":"Song of Myself","path":"/blog/song-of-myself/","author":"Walt Whitman","date":"July 19 2019","hero_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/ren-ran-bBiuSdck8tU-unsplash.08ac62e.082c8ed6431b08ecdaa39f234f700abc.jpg","size":{"width":1000,"height":1500},"sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px","srcset":["/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/ren-ran-bBiuSdck8tU-unsplash.fffb11a.082c8ed6431b08ecdaa39f234f700abc.jpg 480w","/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry/assets/static/ren-ran-bBiuSdck8tU-unsplash.08ac62e.082c8ed6431b08ecdaa39f234f700abc.jpg 1000w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1000 1500' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-06a5d56c250cf33862039b032885c481'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-06a5d56c250cf33862039b032885c481)' width='1000' height='1500' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABgAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAgMBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAABQYCAwcECAAB/8QAOhAAAgECBAQEAwUHBAMAAAAAAQIDBBEABRIhBjFBYRMiUXEHMpEUQlKBoRUWYoKxwdFDcuHwIzPx/8QAGAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAT/xAAeEQEAAgIDAQEBAAAAAAAAAAABAAIRIQMSMUEiMv/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AxrjekjoKmWvyGpqfsrWZhKd9%2bv1wKoOJs3olVpimhl1DxU06h25Xx1Veaioy%2beIX1SjRYb7WO35kn6YbOCuHf3jpaanzKHxKSBdTszKulAfxHZVv/wAYlQaV6znvydt2IhpmFXns7JHH4MVy7mMG3t6bnDPklTqieCrdzUX2dX06x0vvYn3xHiikpcq4jrYqOCGmpJLPHHBISoFtrNbf6YHUtXHT1kJqmUojarj0A/rjbzJWS5qR4jp5IZA8gkAN/n0%2bnbBfhXMaSmj119QsSWuVLWaTttvbsLe%2bOWsqTmOX1LCUFIo9TLYX9foOWA3DeXvXuXs7H1A1YPyDGa7%2bRk4hzd%2bI6sv4fh0saeDEirYBb9v0AwRyHhSNKdZ6iondE8oiFlB7X9PU9j6Y58sMcMskB1F42DHX2BNgOm4GGeozCGKljpFlCaFCavQ28x9%2bn5nCmpNu%2bEw6iDSyrqJxs/w/gh8EpOtNVK4VmhqnZG25NG46diNsZJljJHIyyKzAfeUXt74baDimryLLKibKZY/F2ClwGCE9dJ%2b96dL4N841L8o2cEJ/EuuyQ10VNltIXrtRNQ/jeMVI5KD07jthdbIq6sny7xKeeKmnawd0sgPpcbfXfEvh/l0ma5siyndn1O7gsWN78huf749WZblyTZYtJLTSTwsvmVwsajuFXf8ATGMkm/h61nnPiLhuWCnYQsjx20F47hb/AIdRNmPYYF8GQVEFWlLZ4pI7h2Q6WPa/QY2virLpsnqQZqeZKZhpjqGteJLW8OMcg7GwBt19BbCNPlUdJnFLWxFVjlleIBSQLIQrPfnp1nSDuTYk88U0yRdBqzgzfhzwhJmdKZpiu8isdY97gnl6HDBw/wAMw5lQLUpqmkFj4dwNatupU8lY2IB5alIPzDBrNomo8grsxYjTTRsHaQgOhA%2bUm/mG4uDfYggkHYf8FM5o6nhgLV1kFPUUBaNjOwCSRNvpIJ3HLuCLjridwHM1cpEf4M8P0OZ5dmjVzmOWCQSFupj0nl%2bYOGir%2bH9LPI0ksPhHQZ5EP%2blGASNR6ubHsLN7m7gvI6mnnSGmhLwq4EwjAOi299R5odtudmBHM40lJkrZqxDTt4UreebWAALKAD6bKRv%2bM4DbFkhvbNm3kSeF%2bC2y3MFC3VkCki17XJBB9RqW1saZl1mhhZ6cM5UOumMPt2BkDYWI%2bJKuh4lzBZMtDKqlAEezg%2bIZbkHY8zy6Y%2b4pzNaXLhUBNAgmZY1ZQzKjjUptyJU226qTgaidw8ZV8Zszjj4GrhFPapp5ImigkdlYSaxp8knmH8pIxm2XyZlmGWZdTRRpFPSxqBKxuBqlDDbs2E2s4truJeL8vps20JSUtQzRRW2Q2Nhc7hbi9uWHx87poTIsZCmRXRVHMBxcD3Vxb%2bYYpUxG5BMCTu4ny9ZcolgrKlpi6pohQlY7WFrjmxAe2/4QBhYb4YzsYTRyNHIw8kUsel5T/DGfNp/ia2GTLpzmNcjzSIrg3dr8mudh5l5XIvfGg5dRUaUzKZmkEnzQw2Af/cIgWb%2bZsBcxeO1jxlPB7iHLUrxE8sMvmVqdryRqOXl21WHpc2HLHZmlYS32miaJq2WMy00yf%2butQfNE4/Fb/o3GM54AqanLskjapmVKj5jIlz5uel16juPMOYPTFvEPE8HiN4Bem8Y%2bKUP%2bjUjcOvZuR%2bvU4AEXPyFavNo5K6nrILmN49KauemxkjB7qyuntg1w/FFmCpTTaXgNW8Nm32tLb6BV%2bmMf/boKML2IcuB6XYNb66/rh74Kz%2bCKKCSWQKoeaodj0%2b7f6M5/LFEEg673M3%2bOHB9Pw5n4zDJUkSjmc616RShiNj6Gx/O%2bAfB8lRmeYKoJadzZbn5ARzHfoP8A5jeOKRS57wjmMNfGoc0ksrlucUjapVHuoAP548xZbmVTk9dHUUUmiUAE3FwR6EdcTq5MTt488vGn0nrrg3Ivs1AojM/iJYMIXBI90cBh7b4jx/xD%2b6fD1RXvVVrsnlSJo1j1MeQPlxhtB8auIYMu%2bzPTUU7qRokkBOlfQD/nCPmGYZlxDXGWvqZZ5mO2tiVX2HQY3VZqcCf1qbvDncdNQLFHmFekajYJm8Sp/nCZn0iVDtLCSzMTeUyPLq93ewb%2bUHHBS5zNVRhozHrI5krf9Evj8n1OxMrmWTqvbvck2/3G38JxTU5uuHcAVT7kuCt/vJ1/LEYM4qKR40ibWlwBtte9wCPfpg9LQpIrmX7u8jAbIPwjufr7bDAPOcs/Z8bVBOkqLkDax22H5m35YErVq6Yy5nWVlfkZo5GljEpKOA1jcncEnmW6k%2b3bCDBkU0mYSUzrJ4iOE0lfMxPQDEUzusLCNJCy23DC%2bG/hWvkkqUrauQGRdSINPqD/AH/rhEa%2bStS3DVl1L8N9SxPPWyRq9yECAkAC5/qB7kYc8k4F4dpKORqmMy%2bGCJJ5JGIuDZiLEbA%2bUW%2bZuXLFX7VRFSaNr6acso9G2I/VRiyLNhF9lpoZVURWZS3IMLqrHstpH9yMJv6yDyXfWZbTwlVDQsVI59B7W/t0G5wQjzaWKBAIxa%2b3h%2bW/cenvzxSqp9lUyECIbBQPm7W/tzPXEYwrtYkeI2wHMIPX/PewxWWQfZeeKHQKgpFsnyKp2BvzPrv/AJwuZrmE9dKTNI2m9wgva/8AfBXMEgQlYzY2CqOfLmcUURiOZL/41lVEsNO1z3xsRqFa7CRpqYfspEhQ%2bK3ndrD9ScfZXRVE7BQxCgFjvhhCpIGFkldOanaOP3HX25ntgvTUgFFDUwC95dE6abW5FSB0v/3kcCzEbu4Mjhm8EBUksAL6pNhv7euOZ6epMjFrqR8wPMfXDvULDFD5Cisb6WI21AbqfdbH69QMKtTVQSxBmuiC5Uk30jt2xLyKKz//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"content":"<p>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the<br>\nbeginning and the end.
